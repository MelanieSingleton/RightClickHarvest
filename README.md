# RightClickHarvest
Right click crop harvesting spigot plugin for Minecraft 1.18.1

Usage is simple, right clicking a crop will automatically harvest it and use a modified version of the vanilla loot 
tables to provide drops to players. Fortune is accounted for. Includes an enum for managing loot that may be useful in larger projects.

Feel free to use this for any of your own purposes, though I'd appreciate crediting me.
